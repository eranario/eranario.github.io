I work on developing AI-driven tools to accelerate plant phenotyping by combining advanced sensing technologies with machine learning. My research focuses on improving plant trait identification using generative AI and enhancing model performance through synthetic data. By integrating low-cost sensors and scalable data collection methods, I aim to make high-resolution crop analysis more accessible and efficient.
